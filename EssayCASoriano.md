# ADA-Application  
Essay for WINTER 2018 COHORT 9

#### 1.	Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?

   I have always found myself fascinated in how things are made to work. I love tinkering on our household appliances and my husband’s electric tools, especially if they seem to be busted. I do searches online for FIY (fix it yourself) tutorials, and tinker away! In a way, programming lets me do the same thing. I can become an inventor, architect, engineer or developer anywhere in the world _(even inside the comforts of my toilet)_, with just the use of my laptop.

   I have started getting my hands to programming when I learnt about ADA and their program for women from my husband. About a month ago I started with ADA’s recommended JUMPSTART program. At the same time, I tried crowd sourcing on my facebook page for my friends’ help on what sources or programs I should try for beginners in this _“code”_ world. Most of their suggestions are actually the sources for the readings and assignments that were mention and included in the jumpstart coursework. I have also updated my macOS and downloaded the list of required softwares to practice on. I keep on furnishing my skills by rereading assignments and practicing codes and commands in my laptop's terminal in the best of my abilities. When I find things a bit confusing, I turn to youtube channels for some clarity. 
    
#### 2.	If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years? 

   Being a new mom, I didn’t really have time for anymore of my fancies. I have dedicated myself in taking care of our home and my little daughter. As I have mentioned earlier, my husband was the one who introduced me to this program. He pushed me to look into it and gave his all out support should I be accepted in the program in spite of the possibility of relocation and him taking more roles in the house for my daughter. He himself got into a 5 years apprenticeship program for the IBEW Union in California, where he studies and work until he graduates.
   
   His belief and understanding in me, made me break down the wall I placed for my wants; and with his blessing it gave me a burning desire to build a career path for my own. I don’t have to sacrifice my personal career growth by being a wife and a mom.
   
In this day and age, everything we do is already “online” and we are heavily reliant with our electronic devices and all of our phone applications. I see myself working for one of the largest online shop, like Amazon, and steadily climbing that ladder while creating and developing my own phone application, writing websites, if not starting my own company. 

#### 3.	After reading Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement, how will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community? http://adadevelopersacademy.org/program  

   I want to empower all Filipinas here in the United States, in the Philippines and across the world that there is more to it than the four corners of our house and the _“service industry”_ box we are always put in to by society. I want to be a burning representation to all sexist people (that somehow, are the most powerful people in the US and Philippines), that anything they could do we could also do, if not better. I will show them that our _“biological make up”_ makes us harder workers in comparison. Diversity should be look upon intellectually, not by the color of our skin nor our gender. I want to give back by being a confident and capable mother to my child that she can be proud of. And to let all children in my community that all colors in the rainbow are equally beautiful in their own respect.
   
   I want to give back and provide my services to local LGUs and NGOs in my small hometown in the northern part of the Philippines. If you think injustices in the workplace here in the United States are bad, then there are no words to describe what it is like there. In my country, we also deal with the same issues in one's ethnicity and race inspite the fact that we are Filipinos. Education is the first step to reform, followed by practice and enforced by representation. In this seemingly small act, in that seemingly small town, in a third world country, will conjure up the tsunami of acceptance; all I have to do is start the first ripple.       
   
#### 4.	Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?

   One of the greatest mistakes I have made in my life is shying away from opportunities and masking my duties as a student, a daughter, a wife and now a mother to put them aside without even trying. It is true that one of the greatest deterrents in your life you will find is **_yourself_**. And almost every time, in different phases in my life, I have encountered the same enemy. I was already adventurous in my younger age that I have gone to international seminars at the age of 15 and work abroad, away from my family for a year, but I never pushed myself to more opportunities I know I can get and do.  
    
   Now, I am very fortunate to have a partner in life that truly wants the best for me. He assured me that he will shoulder all my duties to him and my daughter, as well as my survival in Seattle. The possibility is limitless if you let yourself be free from all of your reservations, and in immersing myself, I haved paved the first stone . Now, my determination to make myself, my husband and my daughter, proud are fuelling my desire even more to be one of the few to be granted this program.  
    
   They say that mistakes are in the past, and like the past it should only remain in history. But it is important to remember that the history shapes what is and should serve as a guide in what will be.
